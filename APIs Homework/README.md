##### Latitude vs Max Temp
Warmer and more ideal temperatures tend to occur closer to the equator. Moderate correlations of max temperature occur in the northern hemisphere and higher correlations occur in the southern hemisphere.

##### Latitude vs Humidity
A majority of the humidity rates tend to be greater than 60% across all latitude points. There is very low to no correlation of humidity between northern and southern hemispheres.

##### Latitude vs Cloudiness
There is no correlation to cloudiness as this polt shows clouds occur everywhere. There is very low to no correlation of cloudiness between northern and southern hemispheres.

##### Latitude vs Wind Speed
Wind speed appears to be fairly equal across all latitude points. One outlier exists at over 50 mph near latitude 20.
